## 🧠 Overview

**Ditto Clipboard** is a lightweight Windows utility that extends the standard clipboard with a searchable history of copied content. Instead of overwriting the last copied item, Ditto stores multiple entries so users can quickly retrieve text, links, images, and code snippets.

The application runs quietly in the background and is accessed with a configurable shortcut. From there, users can browse, search, and reuse previous clipboard entries, making repetitive tasks and content management significantly faster.

Ditto Clipboard is especially useful for developers, writers, researchers, and anyone who frequently works with copied information. Its minimal footprint and practical design make it a reliable everyday enhancement for Windows workflows.
